# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Survey Form to work towards Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts:** I need to analyze the design before starting the HTML.  I get ahead of myself and don't think about how to organize and nest the divs to achieve the desired layout.  I need to sketch it on paper first to get a better idea of how to layout everything.

### Day 2: April 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added Styles with CSS to freeCodeCamp Survey Form

**Thoughts:** Even though the HTML passed the tests, I wanted to challenge myself and add CSS styles to make the form look closer to the example given.  I then tried to push it a bit further and add some styles to the text fields and made sure the textarea was responsive.  I wished I could have given the radio buttons and checkboxes an outline, but that will be something to work out another day.

### Days 3 & 4: April 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Contributed to an open source project on GitHub and began creating the HTML framework for the freeCodeCamp Landing Page

**Thoughts:** I found a first-timers-only issue through Twitter and claimed the issue.  I already made the fix and submitted a Pull Request.  It wasn't anything major, but it allowed me to contribute to a group project and get a bit better footing within GitHub besides just working on my own projects.  I also started laying the framework for the next project towards the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification (a landing page).

### Day 5: April 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on freeCodeCamp Landing Page

**Thoughts:** Today was pretty unproductive - spent a lot of time not getting much done, but I did add a little more to the landing page to get into a bit of code today.  Also continued working through the 30 days of CSS with Brad Hussey (days 13 and 14 for sticky footers and headers)
