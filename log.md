# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Survey Form to work towards Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts:** I need to analyze the design before starting the HTML.  I get ahead of myself and don't think about how to organize and nest the divs to achieve the desired layout.  I need to sketch it on paper first to get a better idea of how to layout everything.

### Day 2: April 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added Styles with CSS to freeCodeCamp Survey Form

**Thoughts:** Even though the HTML passed the tests, I wanted to challenge myself and add CSS styles to make the form look closer to the example given.  I then tried to push it a bit further and add some styles to the text fields and made sure the textarea was responsive.  I wished I could have given the radio buttons and checkboxes an outline, but that will be something to work out another day.

### Days 3 & 4: April 20 & 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Contributed to an open source project on GitHub and began creating the HTML framework for the freeCodeCamp Landing Page

**Thoughts:** I found a first-timers-only issue through Twitter and claimed the issue.  I already made the fix and submitted a Pull Request.  It wasn't anything major, but it allowed me to contribute to a group project and get a bit better footing within GitHub besides just working on my own projects.  I also started laying the framework for the next project towards the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification (a landing page).

### Day 5: April 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on freeCodeCamp Landing Page

**Thoughts:** Today was pretty unproductive - spent a lot of time not getting much done, but I did add a little more to the landing page to get into a bit of code today.  Also continued working through the 30 days of CSS with Brad Hussey (days 13 and 14 for sticky footers and headers)

### Day 6: April 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through 30 Days of CSS (Brad Hussey) and did more JavaScript with freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I've been seeing a lot about JavaScript lately and it's something I've worked my way through but it just doesn't seem to sink in.  I decided to commit to working through more of the curriculum on freeCodeCamp to start and then I will work through 30 days of JavaScript (not sure yet if I will tackle that once I finish the 30 days of CSS or if I'll start sooner).

### Day 7: April 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a Modal Window with CSS and worked through more JavaScript on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I worked through more of the curriculum for JavaScript on freeCodeCamp including a function that returned a particular phrase depending on how close you were to par.  While it was a very simplistic function, it was a challenge that wasn't as clearly laid out so it felt good to complete it correctly on the first attempt.  It also helped me to understand an instance where I could put a function like that to use.  I'm sure others will think it's very rudimentary, but it was a big win for me in understanding JavaScript which has been difficult for me to grasp.

### Day 8: April 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a Pacman animation with pure CSS and worked through more JavaScript on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Creating a more complex animation with pure CSS was fun and satisfying.  I also spent time working through more of the JavaScript challenges on freeCodeCamp, but it's not coming quite as easily as it did yesterday.  I just have to take it one day at a time.

### Day 9: April 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created tooltip with CSS and finished Basic JavaScript challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** It feels like a MAJOR accomplishment to complete all of the JavaScript challenges, but I still don't feel as though I have a solid grasp of the language in order to create things on my own with it.  I am getting better at understanding the language, which is a plus.  I'll continue to seek out ways to learn and implement it with practical, real-worl applications.

### Days 10 & 11: April 27-28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created loading progress bars and animated pyramid with pure CSS and started JavaScript Basics with Mosh

**Thoughts:** I didn't get as much time to code this weekend as I was working on other personal branding projects (converting logo to a vector image, designing a business card, thinking about my new portfolio design layout).  I did complete two more days of pure CSS projects with Brad Hussey and started a JavaScript Basics class by Code with Mosh to try and wrap my head around the language.  I figure repetition will be key with this!

### Day 12: April 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on making my current site responsive

**Thoughts:** I did a litle more pure CSS and JavaScript through courses, but wanted to work on making my existing site responsive.  I still have a ways to go to make it completely fluid and not mess up at certain breakpoints but I'm finding it difficult since it was created desktop first.  I'll try to get the bare minimum and then work on the new site design (this time mobile first).  Still, some progress is better than no progress!

### Day 13: April 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on making my current site responsive with flexbox

**Thoughts:** I made a lot more progress with flexbox to make my static site responsive.  I still need to evaluate the media queries to make any adjustments for smaller screens and figure out the collapsible navigation and make sure the rest of the site is bug free.

**Link to work:** [GitHub branch repository link](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/milestone-website/tree/responsive-wip)

### Day 14: May 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tried new exercises to learn JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I got a book from the local library that tries to teach kids JavaScript basics to create a few games.  I still can't seem to wrap my head around JavaScript, so I figured the book should be at my level.  I think part of the issue is that I've been following a lot of coding exercises and I can retype it, but when I'm presented with a problem to solve using JavaScript, I don't know where to begin.  I'm hoping this will help me better approach situations so I can understand how to code it.

**Link to work:** [GitHub link](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/games-maker)

### Day 15: May 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tried to update site navigation to collapsible menu

**Thoughts:** Since I'm still struggling with JavaScript, I found a resource to create a collapsible menu with CSS only.  It's still not perfect, but better than the JavaScript I was attempting (which pushed the headers down).  I'll continue to work on the site, but hopefully have it live soon.

**Link to work:** [GitHub branch repository link](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/milestone-website/tree/responsive-wip)

**Today's Progress**: Tried new exercises to learn JavaScript

### Day 16: May 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the last game in the JS Games Maker book

**Thoughts:** I finished the games in the book I got from our library. I still don't feel confident in JavaScript, but seems to be spending a little less time trying to get things to work.  I think I'm going to wait until I'm done with CSS30 (and have a few more days of the 21 day challenge in JS under my belt) to tackle the JS in 30 days.

**Link to work:** [GitHub link](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/games-maker)

### Day 17: May 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Another project from CSS30 and a few other small CSS projects

**Thoughts:** I didn't have much time to code today, so I just continued with the CSS30 projects (this was how to use CSS to create a 3D layer effect) and a few other small CSS projects.

**Link to work:** [GitHub link](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/css30)

### Day 18: May 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued trying to figure out JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I began the JavaScript30 by creating the drum kit.  I was able to follow along and create the project, but I still don't feel any more confident in my abilities with the language.  I also found a written tutorial to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game.  It was supposed to be for absolute beginners and I had the HARDEST time getting it to fully work.  I was able to get most of the game set up, but had trouble declaring the winner.  I finally was able to rearrange a few elements of the code to make it functional.  It's not pretty looking, but I can come back to the CSS to style it - I feel far more confident doing that.

### Day 19: May 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made some headway with JavaScript (made clock with JS30)

**Thoughts:** I continued the JavaScript30 with a clock.  I even paused the video as instructed to figure out the code needed for the minute and hour hands.  I also adjusted the CSS to adjust the size of the different hands to mimic a true clock.  I also was able to complete the 21 day JS challenge through Lighthouse Labs on the first try!  I'm still going to take in as much as I can, but this feels like a win.

**Link to work:** [GitHub link for JS30](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/JavaScript30)

### Day 20: May 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed more JavaScript tutorials and CSS challenges

**Thoughts:** I continued with the JavaScript30 projects with a way to adjust CSS variables using JavaScript.  I also learned how to use CSS to create a depth of field blur when hovering over images.  I made more progress with Skillcrush courses and will try to finish up making my current site responsive so I can update that while I work on the new site design.

### Day 21: May 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS30 and worked with more JavaScript, finished making site responsive

**Thoughts:** I completed the last day of CSS30 with Brad Hussey - a CSS coffee cup.  I also worked through more JavaScript exercises.  Tonight I am going to try and finish making my static site responsive so I can make that live while I work on the new design and get that coded.  I also finished another design comp for a fictitious photographer and I'd like to try and code that design comp to add to my portfolio as I'm really happy with the final look and I want to see if I can recreate that with code.

### Day 22: May 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on JavaScript and freeCodeCamp's Responsive Design projects

**Thoughts:** Yesterday I uploaded the responsive version of my site through FTP so I can now focus on coding my new design mobile first.  Today I worked on more JavaScript (JS30 project was working with flex panels plus I did more challenges on freeCodeCamp and kept up with Lighthouse Lab's 21 day challenge).  I got back to work on the freeCodeCamp landing page for the responsive design project.  I got it to the point where it passes all of the tests, but I still need to fill in more content and CSS to make it better for my portfolio.  I don't want to settle for just passing the tests.

### Day 23: May 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on JavaScript and freeCodeCamp's Responsive Design projects

**Thoughts:** Not a lot done today, but I did continue the next project in the JS30 list (Type Ahead), continued with the 21-day JS challenge from Lighthouse Labs, and added a bit of CSS to the Landing Page for freeCodeCamp before I submit the project.

### Day 24: May 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with JavaScript30 and 21 day JavaScript challenge

**Thoughts:** Still keeping up JavaScript through the 21 day challenge (frustrated today that I had the correct function, but was considered "incorrect" because I called the function when it didn't need to be calld yet, but still happy that I coded the function correctly on the first try).  I also did more work with arrays through the JavaScript30 course.

### Day 25: May 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Mother's Day - just kept up with JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Spent most of the day visiting for Mother's Day, but I did keep up with JavaScript30 (fun with HTML canvas) and completed today's challenge for Lighthouse Lab's 21-day challenge (on the first attempt).

**Link to work:** [GitHub link for JS30](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/JavaScript30)

### Day 26: May 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript and updated navigation on portfolio site

**Thoughts:** I managed to get the 21-day JavaScript challenge on my first attempt which FLOORED me as it was a bit more involved.  Maybe I'm finally starting to understand JS!!!  I also updated my portfolio site to include a responsive version of the Rogue Pickings website and changed the navigation so that it only collapses on smaller screens.  It's still not perfect, but it's looking more presentable.  I still need to start work on the new design - this time mobile first.  Plus I'd like to code up the design I created for a fictitious photography site as I was very pleased with the overall look and would like to see if I can create that with code.

### Day 27: May 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript and completed Landing Page for fCC Responsive Design certification

**Thoughts:** Didn't do as well on the 21-day JS challenge, but I did get it completed.  I also finised adding content and styling the Landing Page Project for freeCodeCamp.  Only 2 more projects to get the certification!

### Day 28: May 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started another JavaScript course and began next fCC Responsive Design project

**Thoughts:** Today I started a Gale course on JavaScript in hopes that it will be another way to approach and learn the language.  I'm still keeping up with the 21-day challenge and JS30 as well.  I also created the files for the next freeCodeCamp Responsive Design project (Technical Documentation page).

### Day 29: May 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Kept up with JS30 and 21-day challenge, added content to FCC Documentation Page

**Thoughts:** Today I kept up with the 21-day challenge (got it on the first attempt again - hooray!) and JavaScript 30 (today was tracking keystrokes to unlock a hidden secret word).  I also added some of the content to the freeCodeCamp Technical Documentation Page.  PLUS, Adda Birnir of Skillcrush asked if she could use my design comp in an upcoming webinar!  I'm flattered and flabber-ghasted!

### Day 30: May 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Kept up with JS30 and 21-day challenge, added content to FCC Documentation Page, continued JavaScript course

**Thoughts:** Almost done with the 21-day JavaScript challenge and almost halfway through the JS30 projects.  I also spent time adding more of the content to the freeCodeCamp Documentation Page.  I still need to add the navbar, but can work on that later.  Right now one of the tests is failing and I'm not sure why, so I'll have to look into that further.

### Day 31: May 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Kept up with JS30 and 21-day challenge, finished adding content to FCC Documentation Page, continued JavaScript course

**Thoughts:** The 21-day challenge only has a few days left and I feel like I'm finally feeling more confident with it.  We bought and planted flowers today, so not a lot of time coding, but I did finish adding the HTML content to the fCC project (just had to add the nav bar and fix a typo that was causing the tests to fail for content).  Now I get to do the fun part - styling it with CSS!

### Day 32: May 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Kept up with JS30 and 21-day challenge and worked on CSS for fCC Documentation Page

**Thoughts:** I'm now halfway through the JavaScript 30 challenge, but still not particularly confident in my skills.  I think the more I work with JS I become fluent in the terms and language of it, but can't seem to make it function (ha!) on my own.  I tried to do some "extra credit" for today's project by adding an uncheck all button, but I couldn't get it to work as anticipated.  Maybe I'll try another day.  In other news, I have the fCC Documentation Page mostly styled - I just need to add a media query, troubleshoot, and then I'll be ready to submit and work on the last project!

### Day 33: May 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Kept up with JS30 and 21-day challenge and finished fCC Documentation Page

**Thoughts:** Only one more day of Lighthouse Labs' 21-day challenge and I also finished the Documentation Page for freeCodeCamp.  Only one more project and it's a portfolio page.  I didn't look at the specifics, but the sample pen looks pretty simple and it's the most similar to projects I've done for Skillcrush so hopefully it will be quick to do.

### Day 34: May 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the 21-day JavaScript challenge from Lighthouse Labs and started the freeCodeCamp Portfolio Site

**Thoughts:** I am so proud of myself for working my way through all of the JS challenges from Lighthouse Labs.  Several days I got stuck and had to get help from the hints and forum, but I was able to complete them ALL!  I was most proud when I could complete a challenge on the first attempt with no help.  Today I also started laying the basic HTML content for the freeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio project (the last of the Responsive Design projects).  I'm also 1/3 of the way through this 100 days of code!

### Day 35: May 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript30 and JavaScript course through Gale Courses

**Thoughts:** Today was busy, but I still kept up with learning more JavaScript.  I learned how to total up times with JavaScript and also found out more about the inherit objects like screen, window, navigator, etc.  I didn't get to work on my freeCodeCamp project, but maybe tomorrow!

### Day 36: May 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with JavaScript30 and continued working on fCC Responsive Design project

**Thoughts:** Today's project with JavaScript30 was working with the webcam.  At first I wasn't familiar with setting up a local server with node.js and JSON, but was able to figure it out so I could see if my code was working.  I also worked on adding more projects and code to my freeCodeCamp Responsive Design project (last one!).

### Day 37: May 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with JavaScript30 and Intro to JavaScript Gale course

**Thoughts:** The JavaScript30 project worked with a local server again, so I got more practice installing that with node.  I also learned how to set up language recognition.  I continued with my Intro to JavaScript Gale course which included a basic example of an if...else statement to determine pricing by age.  I then tried to recreate that idea but using a Blackjack idea to determine whether to hit or stay based on the value of the card entered.

### Day 38: May 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued JavaScript30 and worked on CSS styles for fCC Portfolio Site

**Thoughts:** I worked hard on my CSS styles for my freeCodeCamp responsive portfolio site.  I'm liking the way it looks, but I need to add a media query and work on making it a bit more responsive.  I also need to figure out why it's failing the test of having the welcome section fill the viewport.

### Day 39: May 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished my last Responsive Design project for freeCodeCamp - a personal portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** While the page isn't completely perfect, it did give me a chance to try out some styles for my new portfolio page design.  I'll want to fine-tune it a bit more to match my design comp, but this was good practice.

### Day 40: May 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with JS30 and began modifying my portfolio site for fCC to be more like my design comp.

**Thoughts:** Today is Memorial Day and we took a long walk so I didn't spend as much time coding.  I did continue with JavaScript30, did a few ES6 exercises on freeCodeCamp.  I also began making modifications to my fCC portfolio site to make it more like the design comp I made.

### Day 41: May 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS30 was creating sticky nav which is helpful and continued work on making my portfolio site closer to my design comp with multiple pages.

**Thoughts:** Today was the most practical project for me with the JavaScript30 - learning how to create a sticky nav bar.  I also continued to work a bit on my portfolio site to expand it to multiple pages and more closely resemble my design comp.  I also tried to work through some more ES6 curriculum on freeCodeCamp, but struggling even more with that than just plain JavaScript.

### Day 42: May 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Just JavaScript today - JS30 and more work with Gale courses

**Thoughts:** Today was busy with NKYAG and other Skillcrush work so I didn't spend as much time coding.  I did make it a point to keep up with JS30 which was a quick lesson to learn more about event capture, bubbling, and once.  I also continued with the Intro to JavaScript Gale course and will build upon that tomorrow to help the principles stick even more.

### Day 43: May 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript today - JS30 and more work with Gale courses

**Thoughts:** Continued work with JavaScript with JS30 and Gale courses.  I was able to easily add a third search option to the Gale course activity and learned how to create a follow-along dropdown nav with JavaScript.  I think I may try to use JavaScript to add the dropdown menu for the Portfolio page of my website so visitors can jump to a specific type of work (web, design, or crafts).

### Day 44: May 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript30 and freeCodeCamp JavaScript curriculum

**Thoughts:** Only a few more projects left in the JavaScript30 course and I also spent more time on the JavaScript curriculum on freeCodeCamp (I'm through Basic JavaScript, ES6, and today I did the Regular Expressions and Debugging sections).  I also created a repository where I can try to set up a JavaScript dropdown navigation and image modal windows before I implement it on my website.  That way I can test it in a plainer environment and try to understand the methods a bit more before adding it to a bigger project.

### Day 45: June 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript today - JS30 and more work with Gale courses along with a bit of freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Only 2 days left of JS30 and I did more work with Gale courses and freeCodeCamp curriculum.  I'm still feeling really uncertain about what comes next and whether I am (or ever will be) ready for it.  I lean towards the design side of things, but I like knowing how things work (using code).  JavaScript has been the biggest struggle and while I grasp some things (the language and how to set things up) I still don't feel confident to start with a blank code file and make it do what I want.  I think I need to start some projects from scratch (similar, but not the same as, some projects I've done with tutorials to see if I can get things working.  console.log() here I come!

### Day 46: June 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript today - Gale courses and freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** First day I missed of JavaScript30, but I will either do both remaining projects tomorrow or just postpone it by one day.  Spend time visiting the grandparents and then ended up with a headache that sidetracked me a bit.  I did continue with some freeCodeCamp JavaScript challenges (completed the Basic Data Structures and began the Basic Algorithm Scripting).  If nothing else, my Google search skills are getting stronger!  I also did a bit more work with Gale courses which covered how to change CSS styles with JavaScript.  That may be my way to better get a handle on JS - working with a language (design) that I comprehend more.

### Day 47: June 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More freeCodeCamp JavaScript (Algorithm Scripting) and JS30 (one more project to go)

**Thoughts:** Only did one project of the JS30 today and spent time working on more freeCodeCamp curriculum.  The Algorithm Scripting is more about problem solving but I still struggle with figuring out how to approach the problem.  Once I see the solution I can reverse engineer it and understand how it goes about utilzing the data in that way, but I can't seem to get there on my own.  I also did a bit more setup on my JavaScript testing files.

### Day 48: June 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Last JS30 project (whack-a-mole) and more freeCodeCamp JS

**Thoughts:** Completed the last project from JS30, but now I want to see if I can transfer some of that knowledge into my own projects.  Also completed the algorithm scripting section of freeCodeCamp and began working through object oriented programming (much more my style).

### Day 49: June 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript today - Gale courses and freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Busy day between NKYAG and family in town, but I did spend some time doing JavaScript with my Gale course and freeCodeCamp object oriented programming exercises.  I can't believe tomorrow will already be the halfway mark!

**Link to work:** [Gale course GitHub repository](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/gale-intro-js)

### Day 50: June 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Gale course learning to create photo carousel

**Thoughts:** Another busy day wih the kiddos, but did take some time to work on creating a photo carousel.  This course so far has been really helpful for understanding JavaScript.  I need to see if there is an advanced course offered by the same instructor so I can continue to improve.

**Link to work:** [Gale course GitHub repository](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/gale-intro-js)

### Day 51: June 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Gale course finishing the photo carousel

**Thoughts:** Still not getting much done while the kids are in town, but I did complete the photo carousel and liked the breakdown of how to set up the JavaScript to code the previous/next buttons.  It helped me figure out a bit more how to approach these types of problems.  Still not feeling fully confident in my ability to tackle these without guidance first, but hopefully I'll get there.

**Link to work:** [Gale course GitHub repository](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/gale-intro-js)

### Days 52 & 53: June 9 & 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Gale course, freeCodeCamp JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Trying to keep up with coding even during the busy times.  Even a little bit helps.  I continued working through the freeCodeCamp JavaScript exercises and the Gale course.  I recreated the code for the photo carousel looking at the previous code to create a carousel with 10 images instead.  I may try to add more to it (transitions, hover effects when selecting images, etc).

**Link to work:** [Gale course GitHub repository](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/gale-intro-js)

### Day 54: June 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Gale course, freeCodeCamp JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I worked more through the Gale course (covering arrays and loops) and JavaScript (more functional programming).  I still struggle with how to approach problems in JavaScript, but it seems so integral for interactivity and concise code for a website that I really want to master this language.  I also need to kick the job search into high gear and that will begin with updating my live website with more projects and then continuing to work on the new website design that better matches my business cards and personal branding.

### Day 55: June 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Gale course

**Thoughts:** Still catching up after the kids were in town and I'm just about there.  Today I did a bit more in the Gale course (working with timer events such as setInterval and setTimeout).  Tomorrow I will work on using that to create a slideshow and then I can get back into updating my portfolio sites with more projects while I work on fully fleshing out my newer portfolio site design.

**Link to work:** [Gale course GitHub repository](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/gale-intro-js)

### Day 56: June 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Gale course

**Thoughts:** I am finally all caught up with my Gale courses (until tomorrow *sigh*) but today I worked on a JavaScript slideshow.  We started with a basic slideshow that used a setInterval timer to switch between images.  We then improved it by adding classes to fade in/out.  I also followed code to add a button to start/stop the slideshow.  I was able to follow along with the code, but I'd like to see how I can expand on the code base to create a more interactive slideshow (one that may run on its own, but also includes thumbnails below if the viewer wants to jump around between images).

### Day 57: June 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Gale course

**Thoughts:** Today I worked a bit with jQuery.  I am looking forward to learning how it can help me more easily achieve some of the effects by using the jQuery library.

**Link to work:** [Gale course GitHub repository](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/gale-intro-js)

### Day 58: June 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created Rock, Paper, Scissors game with freeCodeCamp tutorial

**Thoughts:** I followed a freeCodeCamp tutorial to create a rock, paper, scissors game with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I was really pleased with myself for being able to jump ahead in a few spots to figure out how to set up some of the functions.  I don't know that I could have coded it from scratch, but it's reassuring to know that I am getting it.  I also appreciated following along with one person to create a full game from scratch, one that had a bit more to it than some of my simple exercises.  I may try to expand this to include lizard and Spock like from Big Bang Theory.

### Day 59: June 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Functional Programming in JS from freeCodeCamp, Responsive Design course

**Thoughts:** Too busy yesterday to get coding done on Father's Day.  Today I worked through more freeCodeCamp challenges and completed the section on Functional Programming.  Only one more section to tackle in JavaScript and then I'll need to complete the projects for the certification.  I also began working on projects for my responsive design course to improve my knowledge for creating beautifully responsive sites.

**Link to work:** [GitHub pages responsive design link](https://whimsicurl-creations.github.io/responsive-web-design/)

### Day 60: June 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Expanded my Rock, Paper, Scissors game to also include Lizard and Spock options

**Thoughts:** I added more options to my Rock, Paper, Scissors game and updated the images so they would all share a similar style.  I used the exsiting code to figure out how to add the additional options.  I also added more to the HTML so that I could cover the various scenarios of what options win/lose.  I even added a nice hover option that shows the text for each option in case others aren't as familiar with Big Bang Theory.
**Bonus:** I updated my portfolio site with 3 JavaScript projects (Magic 8 Ball, Election Map, and Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game.  I need to get back to redesigning my website, but at least I can update what I have in the meantime.  I need to still add some of my design projects (logo designs and web designs).

### Day 61: June 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Gale course and JS challenges on edabit.com

**Thoughts:** More work with jQuery in my Gale course - today working with toggles and other effects to create a collapsible menu and an accordion.  Also did the bonus exercise to code a button to toggle a CSS class between standard colors (white bg, black text) to inverted (black bg, white text).  Also did some more JS challenges on edabit.com where I'm feeling a lot more confident about my ability to understand and write JavaScript code.  I just need to continue working on thinking through the problems so I can break down the tasks into code snippets.

**Link to work:** [Gale course GitHub repository](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations/gale-intro-js)

### Day 62: June 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript challenges on edabit.com and worked with Media Queries for responsive design

**Thoughts:** Another day that got busier than I anticipated, but I did get to do some more JavaScript challenges on edabit.com.  I'm really liking their format and having done several of their challenges (though I think I'm still working through easier levels right now) I feel like I have a somewhat solid grasp on JavaScript.  I feel more confident in my ability to think through and solve the challenges presented on my own.  I also worked through a bit more of the Responsive Design course, today working with media queries.

**Link to work:** [GitHub pages responsive design link](https://whimsicurl-creations.github.io/responsive-web-design/)

### Day 63: June 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Intro to JavaScript Gale course and continued working with Media Queries

**Thoughts:** I completed my JavaScript course and received the certification (only got one question wrong on the final exam).  I'm pretty proud of completing the course, but I don't want to let my JavaScript slide.  The edabit.com challenges have been helpful for thinking problems through and learning more methods to use when working with numbers, strings, and more.

### Day 64: June 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript challenges on edabit.com and modified Media Queries for responsive design

**Thoughts:** I'm still (for the most part) loving the challenges on edabit.com.  I've run into more struggles recently, but still feel that I'm learning from the problems presented.  I also worked on modifying the site we're working on in the Responsive Web Design course.  I modified the colors and added a border radius for more of the desktop elements.  I didn't make any major changes because I'm not sure how much more we'll be working on this site and I didn't want to deviate too much from the given code.

### Day 65: June 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More JavaScript challenges on edabit.com and updated Media Queries for responsive design course

**Thoughts:** Spent time visiting with the grandparents so not a lot of time to code today.  I did do a few more challenges on edabit.com and also completed the next lesson in my responsive design course.  I updated my color scheme a bit for higher contrast on mobile sites and also added Google fonts to customize.  I added an inset shadow on my nav links when hovered and it's causing a slight shift in elements when you hover.  I'll research  more soon to find out how to keep that from making other elements on the pages jump around a bit.

**Link to work:** [GitHub pages responsive design link](https://whimsicurl-creations.github.io/responsive-web-design/)

### Day 66: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on new portfolio site design (updated nav) and a few more edabit.com challenges

**Thoughts:** I finally got back to my portfolio site redesign.  I worked on updating the navigation to show a submenu for my projects link (which I may update to be Portfolio).  I may still update this again, but for now the design is completely CSS based.  It took longer than anticipated, but I realized that the way my navigation is set up, I needed to have the links come out to the left instead of dropping down.  I'm also getting to more challenging edabit.com challenges but I'm trying to figure them out.

### Day 67: June 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on building visual design skills along with working on personal portfolio site and some JavaScript challenges on edabit.com

**Thoughts:** Tried to work a bit more on my portfolio site, but spent more of the day improving my visual design skills (website wireframes, PhotoShop tools and resources, etc.).  I also did a few more challenges on edabit.com.

**Link to work:** [GitHub repository for new portfolio site design](https://github.com/whimsicurl-creations)

### Day 68: June 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More responsive design work and JavaScript challenges on edabit.com

**Thoughts:** Continued with my responsive design course.  Today I worked on modifying layouts with media queries and floats.  I am working with those for now, but will see whether to keep with that or revert back to flexbox.  Maybe I'll fork the design to try the same content with different formats to compare/contrast.  I'm also keeping up with a few JavaScript challenges each day on edabit.com.

**Link to work:** [GitHub pages responsive design link](https://whimsicurl-creations.github.io/responsive-web-design/)

### Day 69: June 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Mostly responsive design work - creating my own responsive site with floats and flexbox

**Thoughts:** I finished working on my project for Gale course - creating my own site and making it responsive.  The course just used floats so I started with that but was getting frustrated since it doesn't smoothly transition between the different media queries.  I also wanted to compare/contrast using floats vs using flexbox.  Even though I was a bit rusty on flexbox, it was MUCH easier to work with in my opinion and created a cleaner overall site (with the floats it was hard for me to keep everything centered without bumping something down to another line).

### Day 70: June 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked with details/summary tags in HTML5 to create collapsible content

**Thoughts:** Today I learned about the details and summary tags in HTML5 to create collapsible content - good for mobile screens.  I didn't get a lot of practice with it yet, but it is nice to know this is something that can be created without needed CSS or JavaScript (though I did work on styling it a bit with CSS).

**Link to work:** [GitHub pages responsive design link](https://whimsicurl-creations.github.io/responsive-web-design/)

### Day 71: June 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created my own site to get more practice with details/summary tags

**Thoughts:** I practiced using the details/summary tags including nesting them inside one another.  I used article tags for desktop and tablet design, but the details/summary for mobile screens.  I kept the design simple, but defined Harry Potter terms to create my site.

### Day 72: July 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did JavaScript challenges on edabit.com and helped others debug code

**Thoughts:** Today I didn't do much of my own code writing, but I helped several others on Skillcrush's slack site to find and fix problems they were having with their own code.  I like being able to help others and finding bugs in other people's code helps me build skills to work with other developers and use tools to find issues.

**Link to work:** No links to work today (sorry GitHub tile wall), but I used (https://edabit.com/) to continue to build my JavaScript skills.

### Day 73: July 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: JS challenges on edabit.com and added design projects to website

**Thoughts:** I still need to get back to working on my new portfolio design, but in the meantime I also need to keep my live website up to date to showcase more of my projects and abilities.  Today I added some of my design projects (a website design comp, brand style guide, and another responsive website example).  I also did a few more JavaScript challenges on edabit.com

**Link to work:** [Updated website](http://whimsicurlcreations.com/)

### Day 74: July 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked with picture tags and other ways to handle responsive images

**Thoughts:** Today I learned about several different ways to handle images so that you can have quality images without sacrificing download times.  Among the things I worked with were compressing images as well as using figure and picture HTML tags to establish different images to load based on the given viewport size.  These tags weren't as cut and dry, but will definitely be useful in improving load times for mobile users.

### Day 75: July 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning about responsive web image options, today learning about SVG images

**Thoughts:** I took a bit of time to enjoy the 4th and work on other tasks (cleaning!) during the holiday so I didn't do as much coding.  Today the responsive design course taught about SVG files and how they are a vector image file that is pretty widely recognized.  I didn't realize that SVG files could be hard-coded into a project, but I am excited about the possibilities to create and include SVG files in future projects.

### Day 76: July 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Trying to learn how to implement modals in portfolio site

**Thoughts:** Lately I've been working on more visual design and helping others debug HTML and CSS issues without doing a lot of my own coding.  Today I experimented with creating modals using HTML, CSS, and JS.  I'm still trying to understand it (a few tutorials that have walked me through just show a single modal and I'm trying to figure out how to incorporate multiple modals on one page without doubling the amount of code).  I'd love to at the very least have my craft and design images open in a modal versus opening a separate tab/window.  I don't know if it's possible to open a window with a live website, so those may need to remain as external links.

### Day 77: July 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned about HTML5 input types to make forms more responsive for mobile

**Thoughts:** Today I worked with forms and using HTML5 input types to make them friendlier for mobile devices (how it can bring up different types of keyboards and the like to make inputting easier).  I also got more practice with styling a form with CSS (still my favorite part - playing with the design of it all).

### Day 78: July 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Bootstrap to create a button, collapsible nav, and carousel

**Thoughts:** Working through the responsive course I'm in, today was learning about Bootstrap and using some of the widgets offered to create responsive code that I can modify to suit my needs.  While it was nice getting things created so quickly, it still felt like cheating.  I think going in tomorrow to customize the code more will make it feel more like my own.
