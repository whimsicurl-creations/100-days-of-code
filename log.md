# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Survey Form to work towards Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts:** I need to analyze the design before starting the HTML.  I get ahead of myself and don't think about how to organize and nest the divs to achieve the desired layout.  I need to sketch it on paper first to get a better idea of how to layout everything.

### Day 2: April 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added Styles with CSS to freeCodeCamp Survey Form

**Thoughts:** Even though the HTML passed the tests, I wanted to challenge myself and add CSS styles to make the form look closer to the example given.  I then tried to push it a bit further and add some styles to the text fields and made sure the textarea was responsive.  I wished I could have given the radio buttons and checkboxes an outline, but that will be something to work out another day.

### Days 3 & 4: April 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Contributed to an open source project on GitHub and began creating the HTML framework for the freeCodeCamp Landing Page

**Thoughts:** I found a first-timers-only issue through Twitter and claimed the issue.  I already made the fix and submitted a Pull Request.  It wasn't anything major, but it allowed me to contribute to a group project and get a bit better footing within GitHub besides just working on my own projects.  I also started laying the framework for the next project towards the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification (a landing page).

### Day 5: April 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on freeCodeCamp Landing Page

**Thoughts:** Today was pretty unproductive - spent a lot of time not getting much done, but I did add a little more to the landing page to get into a bit of code today.  Also continued working through the 30 days of CSS with Brad Hussey (days 13 and 14 for sticky footers and headers)

### Day 6: April 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through 30 Days of CSS (Brad Hussey) and did more JavaScript with freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I've been seeing a lot about JavaScript lately and it's something I've worked my way through but it just doesn't seem to sink in.  I decided to commit to working through more of the curriculum on freeCodeCamp to start and then I will work through 30 days of JavaScript (not sure yet if I will tackle that once I finish the 30 days of CSS or if I'll start sooner).

### Day 7: April 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a Modal Window with CSS and worked through more JavaScript on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I worked through more of the curriculum for JavaScript on freeCodeCamp including a function that returned a particular phrase depending on how close you were to par.  While it was a very simplistic function, it was a challenge that wasn't as clearly laid out so it felt good to complete it correctly on the first attempt.  It also helped me to understand an instance where I could put a function like that to use.  I'm sure others will think it's very rudimentary, but it was a big win for me in understanding JavaScript which has been difficult for me to grasp.

### Day 8: April 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a Pacman animation with pure CSS and worked through more JavaScript on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Creating a more complex animation with pure CSS was fun and satisfying.  I also spent time working through more of the JavaScript challenges on freeCodeCamp, but it's not coming quite as easily as it did yesterday.  I just have to take it one day at a time.

### Day 9: April 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created tooltip with CSS and finished Basic JavaScript challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** It feels like a MAJOR accomplishment to complete all of the JavaScript challenges, but I still don't feel as though I have a solid grasp of the language in order to create things on my own with it.  I am getting better at understanding the language, which is a plus.  I'll continue to seek out ways to learn and implement it with practical, real-worl applications.

### Days 10 & 11: April 27-28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created loading progress bars and animated pyramid with pure CSS and started JavaScript Basics with Mosh

**Thoughts:** I didn't get as much time to code this weekend as I was working on other personal branding projects (converting logo to a vector image, designing a business card, thinking about my new portfolio design layout).  I did complete two more days of pure CSS projects with Brad Hussey and started a JavaScript Basics class by Code with Mosh to try and wrap my head around the language.  I figure repetition will be key with this!
