# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Survey Form to work towards Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts:** I need to analyze the design before starting the HTML.  I get ahead of myself and don't think about how to organize and nest the divs to achieve the desired layout.  I need to sketch it on paper first to get a better idea of how to layout everything.

### Day 2: April 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added Styles with CSS to freeCodeCamp Survey Form

**Thoughts:** Even though the HTML passed the tests, I wanted to challenge myself and add CSS styles to make the form look closer to the example given.  I then tried to push it a bit further and add some styles to the text fields and made sure the textarea was responsive.  I wished I could have given the radio buttons and checkboxes an outline, but that will be something to work out another day.

### Days 3 & 4: April 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Contributed to an open source project on GitHub and began creating the HTML framework for the freeCodeCamp Landing Page

**Thoughts:** I found a first-timers-only issue through Twitter and claimed the issue.  I already made the fix and submitted a Pull Request.  It wasn't anything major, but it allowed me to contribute to a group project and get a bit better footing within GitHub besides just working on my own projects.  I also started laying the framework for the next project towards the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification (a landing page).

### Day 5: April 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on freeCodeCamp Landing Page

**Thoughts:** Today was pretty unproductive - spent a lot of time not getting much done, but I did add a little more to the landing page to get into a bit of code today.  Also continued working through the 30 days of CSS with Brad Hussey (days 13 and 14 for sticky footers and headers)

### Day 6: April 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through 30 Days of CSS (Brad Hussey) and did more JavaScript with freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I've been seeing a lot about JavaScript lately and it's something I've worked my way through but it just doesn't seem to sink in.  I decided to commit to working through more of the curriculum on freeCodeCamp to start and then I will work through 30 days of JavaScript (not sure yet if I will tackle that once I finish the 30 days of CSS or if I'll start sooner).

### Day 7: April 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a Modal Window with CSS and worked through more JavaScript on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I worked through more of the curriculum for JavaScript on freeCodeCamp including a function that returned a particular phrase depending on how close you were to par.  While it was a very simplistic function, it was a challenge that wasn't as clearly laid out so it felt good to complete it correctly on the first attempt.  It also helped me to understand an instance where I could put a function like that to use.  I'm sure others will think it's very rudimentary, but it was a big win for me in understanding JavaScript which has been difficult for me to grasp.

### Day 8: April 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a Pacman animation with pure CSS and worked through more JavaScript on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Creating a more complex animation with pure CSS was fun and satisfying.  I also spent time working through more of the JavaScript challenges on freeCodeCamp, but it's not coming quite as easily as it did yesterday.  I just have to take it one day at a time.

### Day 9: April 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created tooltip with CSS and finished Basic JavaScript challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** It feels like a MAJOR accomplishment to complete all of the JavaScript challenges, but I still don't feel as though I have a solid grasp of the language in order to create things on my own with it.  I am getting better at understanding the language, which is a plus.  I'll continue to seek out ways to learn and implement it with practical, real-worl applications.

### Days 10 & 11: April 27-28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created loading progress bars and animated pyramid with pure CSS and started JavaScript Basics with Mosh

**Thoughts:** I didn't get as much time to code this weekend as I was working on other personal branding projects (converting logo to a vector image, designing a business card, thinking about my new portfolio design layout).  I did complete two more days of pure CSS projects with Brad Hussey and started a JavaScript Basics class by Code with Mosh to try and wrap my head around the language.  I figure repetition will be key with this!

### Day 12: April 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on making my current site responsive

**Thoughts:** I did a litle more pure CSS and JavaScript through courses, but wanted to work on making my existing site responsive.  I still have a ways to go to make it completely fluid and not mess up at certain breakpoints but I'm finding it difficult since it was created desktop first.  I'll try to get the bare minimum and then work on the new site design (this time mobile first).  Still, some progress is better than no progress!

### Day 13: April 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on making my current site responsive with flexbox

**Thoughts:** I made a lot more progress with flexbox to make my static site responsive.  I still need to evaluate the media queries to make any adjustments for smaller screens and figure out the collapsible navigation and make sure the rest of the site is bug free.

### Day 14: May 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tried new exercises to learn JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I got a book from the local library that tries to teach kids JavaScript basics to create a few games.  I still can't seem to wrap my head around JavaScript, so I figured the book should be at my level.  I think part of the issue is that I've been following a lot of coding exercises and I can retype it, but when I'm presented with a problem to solve using JavaScript, I don't know where to begin.  I'm hoping this will help me better approach situations so I can understand how to code it.

### Day 15: May 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tried to update site navigation to collapsible menu

**Thoughts:** Since I'm still struggling with JavaScript, I found a resource to create a collapsible menu with CSS only.  It's still not perfect, but better than the JavaScript I was attempting (which pushed the headers down).  I'll continue to work on the site, but hopefully have it live soon.

**Today's Progress**: Tried new exercises to learn JavaScript

### Day 16: May 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the last game in the JS Games Maker book

**Thoughts:** I finished the games in the book I got from our library. I still don't feel confident in JavaScript, but seems to be spending a little less time trying to get things to work.  I think I'm going to wait until I'm done with CSS30 (and have a few more days of the 21 day challenge in JS under my belt) to tackle the JS in 30 days.

### Day 17: May 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Another project from CSS30 and a few other small CSS projects

**Thoughts:** I didn't have much time to code today, so I just continued with the CSS30 projects (this was how to use CSS to create a 3D layer effect) and a few other small CSS projects.

### Day 18: May 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued trying to figure out JavaScript

**Thoughts:** I began the JavaScript30 by creating the drum kit.  I was able to follow along and create the project, but I still don't feel any more confident in my abilities with the language.  I also found a written tutorial to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game.  It was supposed to be for absolute beginners and I had the HARDEST time getting it to fully work.  I was able to get most of the game set up, but had trouble declaring the winner.  I finally was able to rearrange a few elements of the code to make it functional.  It's not pretty looking, but I can come back to the CSS to style it - I feel far more confident doing that.

### Day 19: May 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made some headway with JavaScript (made clock with JS30)

**Thoughts:** I continued the JavaScript30 with a clock.  I even paused the video as instructed to figure out the code needed for the minute and hour hands.  I also adjusted the CSS to adjust the size of the different hands to mimic a true clock.  I also was able to complete the 21 day JS challenge through Lighthouse Labs on the first try!  I'm still going to take in as much as I can, but this feels like a win.

### Day 20: May 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed more JavaScript tutorials and CSS challenges

**Thoughts:** I continued with the JavaScript30 projects with a way to adjust CSS variables using JavaScript.  I also learned how to use CSS to create a depth of field blur when hovering over images.  I made more progress with Skillcrush courses and will try to finish up making my current site responsive so I can update that while I work on the new site design.

### Day 21: May 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS30 and worked with more JavaScript, finished making site responsive

**Thoughts:** I completed the last day of CSS30 with Brad Hussey - a CSS coffee cup.  I also worked through more JavaScript exercises.  Tonight I am going to try and finish making my static site responsive so I can make that live while I work on the new design and get that coded.  I also finished another design comp for a fictitious photographer and I'd like to try and code that design comp to add to my portfolio as I'm really happy with the final look and I want to see if I can recreate that with code.

### Day 22: May 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on JavaScript and freeCodeCamp's Responsive Design projects

**Thoughts:** Yesterday I uploaded the responsive version of my site through FTP so I can now focus on coding my new design mobile first.  Today I worked on more JavaScript (JS30 project was working with flex panels plus I did more challenges on freeCodeCamp and kept up with Lighthouse Lab's 21 day challenge).  I got back to work on the freeCodeCamp landing page for the responsive design project.  I got it to the point where it passes all of the tests, but I still need to fill in more content and CSS to make it better for my portfolio.  I don't want to settle for just passing the tests.

### Day 23: May 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on JavaScript and freeCodeCamp's Responsive Design projects

**Thoughts:** Not a lot done today, but I did continue the next project in the JS30 list (Type Ahead), continued with the 21-day JS challenge from Lighthouse Labs, and added a bit of CSS to the Landing Page for freeCodeCamp before I submit the project.

### Day 24: May 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued with JavaScript30 and 21 day JavaScript challenge

**Thoughts:** Still keeping up JavaScript through the 21 day challenge (frustrated today that I had the correct function, but was considered "incorrect" because I called the function when it didn't need to be calld yet, but still happy that I coded the function correctly on the first try).  I also did more work with arrays through the JavaScript30 course.

### Day 25: May 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Mother's Day - just kept up with JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Spent most of the day visiting for Mother's Day, but I did keep up with JavaScript30 (fun with HTML canvas) and completed today's challenge for Lighthouse Lab's 21-day challenge (on the first attempt).
